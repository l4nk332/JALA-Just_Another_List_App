This is a list of pending modification that should be implemented
into JALA but have not been:

###Front-end:

  - Fix CSS Animation so that it is works with larger width
    screen sizes.

  - Add more to the CSS Animation

  - Update the README.md to have clearer install instructions
    and description of dependencies.

  - Consider making checkboxes larger (mobile-friendly).


###Back-end:

  - Update jala_log module to keep track of email submission
    information.

  - Make a api_HTML module that will allow the user to alternatively
    email HTML rather than plain-text.
