#Pending Modifications

This is a list of pending modification that should be implemented
into JALA but have not been:

###Front-end:

  - Fix bug when Toggling Hidden items and then checking additional
    ones.

  - Add functionality allowing user to download the list
    directly to their pc.

  - Add color-changing feedback when user clicks on a
    button, also disabling the button for a period to prevent
    multiple post request in a row if needed.

###Back-end:

  - Email implementation will most likely utilize the [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer)
    module, allowing the user to email the list as plain-text.

  - Add functionality so that export button will initialize
    download of the .txt file.
