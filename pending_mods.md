#Pending Modifications

This is a list of pending modification that should be implemented
into JALA but have not been:

###Front-end:

  - Add a "Save" button that will make a post request
    to save the list and its title.

  - Fix bug when Toggling Hidden items and then checking additional
    ones.

###Back-end:

  - Email implementation will most likely utilize the [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer)
    module, allowing the user to email the list as plain-text.

  - Link-up server-side response for post requests to the
    jala-api.
