#Pending Modifications

This is a list of pending modification that should be implemented
into JALA but have not been:

###Front-end:

  - Fix bug when Toggling Hidden items and then checking additional
    ones.

  - Add a favicon

  - Fine tune css animations

###Back-end:

  - Email implementation will most likely utilize the [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer)
    module, allowing the user to email the list as plain-text.

  - Add a logger that creates .log files a _temp_ folder
    when users make request.
    (i.e Date/Time, IP Address, Request Made)
