#Pending Modifications

This is a list of pending modification that should be implemented
into JALA but have not been:

###Front-end:

  - Fine tune css animations

  - Update the README.md to have clearer install instructions
    and description of dependencies.

  - Consider making checkboxes larger (mobile-friendly).
  

###Back-end:

  - Email implementation will most likely utilize the [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer)
    module, allowing the user to email the list as plain-text.

  - Make a api_HTML module that will allow the user to alternatively
    email HTML rather than plain-text.
