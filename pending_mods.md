#Pending Modifications

This is a list of pending modification that should be implemented
into JALA but have not been:

###Front-end:

  - Add more width to the list (for Windows users) so that
    on hover, the 'X' won't move down.

  - Allow the 'Enter' key to tab through list items.

  - Fine tune css animations

  - Update the README.md to have clearer install instructions
    and description of dependencies.

###Back-end:

  - Email implementation will most likely utilize the [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer)
    module, allowing the user to email the list as plain-text.
