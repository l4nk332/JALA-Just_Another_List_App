#Pending Modifications

This is a list of pending modification that should be implemented
into JALA but have not been:

###Front-end:

  - Fix jQuery drop animation on email form for Firefox.

  - Add color tone changing in early and late daylight hours.

  - Add starry night sky animation to application.

  - Consider making checkboxes larger (mobile-friendly).

  - Allow user to check all list items between two checked items by
    selecting the first item and the Shift-clicking to select the
    next item with all others between.


###Back-end:

  - Configure the application so that if it is night time the
    new starry animation is served as a backdrop, otherwise have
    it be the sunny cloud backdrop.
